#Exercise 2
Ensure you are saving your files and refreshing your HTML anytime a change is being made

Add the remaining mathematical operators (/, *, **, and %)

Each operator needs to function correctly

For every other mathematical operator, ensure your JavaScript logic returns a true statement.

Example: If your first operand is 25 and the second is 7, while your mathematical operator is modulo, your HTML should tell the user the modulo is 4

In other words, explicitly describe to the user what is happening when they change any of the inputs

TEST your code!

##Exercise 3
Objective: Add the remaining comparison operations (>, <, !=)
For every other comparison operator, ensure your JavaScript logic returns a true statement.

Example: If your first operand is 3 and the second is 2, while your comparison operator is >, your HTML should tell the user both operandsâ€™ data types and if their values match the logic (is 3 > 2?).

In other words, explicitly describe to the user what is happening when they change all the inputs
